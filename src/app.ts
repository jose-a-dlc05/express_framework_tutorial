// 1. Import/Require the express module
// 2. Declare a const app and initialize it with the express function returned from the imported express module which will be an object with many methods
// 3. Call the get method from app and enter 2 arguments: a path string and a callback function that take in the req and res arguments
// 4. Within the callback function, you can do a couple of things:
// a. Use the response.send method which will return the string written as an argument
// b. Use the req.params() method to take in and responde with parameters
// c. Use the req.query() method to take in and response with query strings
